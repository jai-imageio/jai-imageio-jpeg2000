jai-imageio-jpeg2000
====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-jpeg2000.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-jpeg2000)

JPEG2000 support for Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools API core
[jai-imagecore-core](https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-core).

The `jj2000` package in this module is licensed under the
[JJ2000 license](LICENSE-JJ2000.txt) and is therefore
[not compatible with the GPL 3 license](https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-core/issues/4).

**WARNING** - from the [JJ2000 license](LICENSE-JJ2000.txt):

> Those intending to use
> this software module in hardware or software products are advised that
> their use may infringe existing patents. The original developers of
> this software module, JJ2000 Partners and ISO/IEC assume no liability
> for use of this software module or modifications thereof. No license
> or right to this software module is granted for non JPEG 2000 Standard
> conforming products.

**NOTE**: This is a module extracted from the
[java.net project jai-imageio-core](https://java.net/projects/jai-imageio-core/).
It depends on the [jai-imageio-core](https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-core)
module.

There is **NO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT** in this repository; any commits here are
just to keep the build working with recent versions of Maven/Java and to fix
regressions against previous releases.

If you are not concerned about GPL compatibility or source code
availability, you might instead want to use
https://github.com/geosolutions-it/imageio-ext/ which is actively
maintained and extends the original imageio with many useful features,
but depends on the
[binary distribution of jai_core](http://download.osgeo.org/webdav/geotools/javax/media/jai_core/1.1.3/).
